# Bit-Manipulation
A collection of programs which deal with bit manipulation algorithms

XOR_Decryption.c - A solution to project euler problem 59: XOR decryption
- Decrypt the included cipher text (0059_cipher.txt) of comma-separated encrypted ASCII codes and find the sum of the original plain text ASCII codes.
- The encryption key is three lowercase alphabetic characters.
- The plain text must contain common English words. 

Double-base_Palindromes.c - A solution to project euler problem 36: Double-base Palindromes
- Find the sum of all natural numbers less than 1,000,000 which are double-base palindromes.
- A number is a double-base palindrome if it is a palindrome in both base 10 and base 2. For example, 585 = 1001001001.
- A palindromic number in either base cannot include leading zeros.
